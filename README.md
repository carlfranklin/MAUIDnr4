# Building a Mobile Podcast Client App in MAUI Blazor Part 4

## Overview

In episode 28 of [The .NET Show](https://www.thedotnetshow.com/), I started building a Podcast Client MAUI app using Blazor as the UI for my long-running podcast, [.NET Rocks](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/). In episode 30 I added guest info and links to the Details page. I also got a head start on the Playlist functionality, which allows the user to manage and use playlists (lists of shows that should play one-after another). In episode 30, I implemented the playlist functionality. In this episode we'll add more features such as pre-downloading the playlist audio files and metadata, and we'll also add a sleep timer to stop playing after a certain amount of time. A certain number of decisions will have to be made, and we'll talk about them as well.

This is the fourth in a series of episodes where we take this app from nothing all the way to the app store.

This type of app is called a Mobile Hybrid app. Yes, we're using Blazor, a web UI technology, but the code has access to the native platform: Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android.
